## R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Import Lib

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(rmarkdown)
```

## Create Varaible
```{r var}
sample3 <- c("Male","Female","Male","Female","Female")
gender <- factor(sample3)
class(gender)
summary(gender)
```

## Explore Data
```{r explore}
glimpse(starwars)
```

## Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```

## Transformation Data
```{R}
starwars %>% group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(height=mean(height,na.rm = T),mass=mean(mass,na.rm = T)) %>%
  mutate(BMI = mass / ((height/100)^2)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(BMI)) %>%
  head(10)
```

## Notes
- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the **R code** 
but the result will shown

### Save
- Click button `Knit` to save in HTML
- If output is `github_document` using `render("fileName.Rmd")` run in console to save
